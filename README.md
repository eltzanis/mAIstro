## 🚀 About mAIstro
**mAIstro** is an autonomous, open-source multi-agentic system designed to orchestrate the full pipeline of medical imaging AI development - from **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **radiomics feature extraction** to **training and deploying deep learning models**.  
Built around a team of specialized agents, mAIstro enables researchers and clinicians to interact with complex AI workflows **using natural language prompts** - no coding required.

🌐 **LLM-Agnostic Design**: mAIstro can operate with both open-source and commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, LLaMA, Qwen), providing flexibility across environments.

⭐ If you find mAIstro useful, please consider starring the repository to support the project and help others discover it!

What’s included:

All necessary requirements are automatically installed

The full mAIstro_workspace folder is downloaded, including:

  ✅Experiment data

  ✅Predefined folders and structure

  ✅Ready-to-run example prompts pointing to the correct locations

🔐 What you need to do:
The only manual step is to provide your API key for the LLM of your choice (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.).

A pre-configured cell is provided with options for multiple LLM providers – just paste your key and you're ready to go!

This makes it easy to explore and test the full functionality of mAIstro on any device, using just your browser.
